      This model contains a mapping of individual condition ICD-10-CM diagnosis 
      codes to the CCSR's clinically meaningful diagnosis categories. Each row 
      represents a mapping of an ICD-10 code to a CCSR category. As each ICD-10 
      code may be mapped to up to 6 categories, it's expected that this table 
      will output as many or more rows than the TUVA condition model. The model 
      is equivalent to the CCSR's Output Option 1 - Vertical File Output.
