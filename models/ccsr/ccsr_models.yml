    description: |
      This is an intermediate model that pivots the DXCCSR's wide-format mapping CSV
      into a long format table. While the seed uses 6 columns to represent the 6 CCSR codes that
      may be present, this generates one row for each CCSR category per ICD code, so up to
      6 rows per code. 

      This model includes details and descriptions of the CCSR parent category and body systems that are inherited by the final models.

      This model may also be useful in looking up CCSR condition category, body system, and parent category information.
    columns:
      - name: code
        description: The ICD-10-CM code
      - name: code_description
        description: The description of the ICD-10-CM code included in the seed file.

          6 CCSR categories associated, ordinally ranked by the ccsr_category_rank.

          referenced in the CCSR seed file."
