/* 
Determine all eligible beneficiaries for claims-based assignment.

The AALR provides fields neeeded to determine eligibility for prospective assignment, but not retrospective assignment.
Therefore, this file uses the AALR to determine assignment eligibility.

Instructions can be found in the CMS SHARED SAVINGS AND LOSSES, ASSIGNMENT AND QUALITY PERFORMANCE STANDARD METHODOLOGY (SLAAM) for a given year.
All of the page references for the SLAAM below are referring to the 2025 SLAAM here: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/medicare-shared-savings-program-shared-savings-and-losses-and-assignment-methodology-specifications.pdf-4
This code should be reviewed yearly to ensure it stays up to date with the yearly SLAAM releases.

This model is based on pages 12-13 of the SLAAM.

/* All of the instructions for determining eligible beneficiaries are summarized into the 'EXCLUDED' column,
which makes this model simple.
