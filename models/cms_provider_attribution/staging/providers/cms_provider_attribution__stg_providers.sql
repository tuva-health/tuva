/**** Primary Care Physicians: Section 2.1, Table 1, E ****

"Beneficiary had at least one primary care service with a
physician who is an ACO professional in the ACO, and is a
primary care physician (defined in ยง 425.20) or has a primary
specialty designation specified in ยง 425.402(c) (listed in
Appendix C, Table 11)."

The SLAAM says that CCNs are to be used from the provider/supplier list and TINs for all else for purposes of 
assignment.
p.17 of the SLAAM, "For ease of reference, in this document we refer to use of the ACO Participant List more
generally for assignment operations, although these references (unless otherwise specified)
refer to use of TINs specified on the certified ACO Participant List, and Method II CAHs, ETA
hospitals, and FQHCs and RHCs identified based on CCNs sourced from PECOS, as specified
on the ACO Provider/Supplier List."
