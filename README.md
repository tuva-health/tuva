## 🧰  What is the Tuva Project?
The Tuva Project code base includes a core data model, data marts, terminology 
sets, and data quality tests for doing healthcare analytics.

**Explore the project:**

- [Code](./models)
- [Terminology Sets](seeds/terminology)*
- [Value Sets](seeds/value_sets)
- [Data Dictionaries / DAG](https://tuva-health.github.io/tuva/#!/overview/)
- [Knowledge Base](https://thetuvaproject.com/)

*Note: In many cases the actual terminology sets are too large to maintain on 
GitHub, so we host them in a public AWS S3 bucket. Executing dbt build will 
load the terminology sets from S3.

Check out our Quickstart guide [here](./QUICKSTART.md).
