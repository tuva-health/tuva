      The eligibility table includes information about a patient's health 
      insurance coverage and demographics (note: we use the word patient as a 
      synonym for member). Every claims dataset should include some sort of 
      eligibility data, otherwise it's impossible to calculate member months, 
      which are needed to calculate measures like PMPM.
