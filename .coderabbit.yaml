              This is a dbt project that must stay as close to ANSI SQL as practical and remain portable across warehouses (priority: Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, BigQuery, Microsoft Fabric, DuckDB).
              
              Review goals for models:
              * Prefer ANSI constructs and dbt_utils macros over vendor-specific functions.
              * Call out non-portable functions/syntax (examples to flag in review): to_date(...), right(...), count(arg1, arg2), :: casts, IFF/DECODE, QUALIFY, SAFE_OFFSET/SAFE_CAST, TOP, LIMIT vs QUALIFY patterns, etc. If needed, wrap in a macro that uses adapter.dispatch or dbt_utils.
              * Enforce explicitness for readability and correctness: explicit JOIN types, explicit UNION ALL/DISTINCT, avoid DISTINCT + GROUP BY together, and avoid ambiguous GROUP BY / ORDER BY ordinals if the project policy is explicit column names.
              * Maintain style consistency with the repo SQLFluff configuration: lowercase keywords/identifiers/functions/literals/types, leading commas, newline after CTE blocks, newline at end of file, consistent spacing.
              * Integration safety: do not hardcode database/schema; use ref()/source() (and package-qualified refs if integrating models from another dbt package).
              * Try and call out use of the keyword DISTINCT, and suggest other ways to address this if it makes sense.
              * Look for a single model doing too much, and if so, suggest possibly breaking up logically into multiple models.
              * Check model names to make sure they make sense. Intermediate models should contain `int` in the model name, and staging models should contain `stg` in the name. File names should be all lowercase, and seperated by underscores.

          instructions: |
              Macros are the portability layer. Prefer encapsulating non-ANSI behavior here (instead of in models) using:
              * adapter.dispatch to implement warehouse-specific overrides with a single stable macro API.
              * dbt_utils macros where appropriate for cross-database behavior.
              
              Review goals for macros:
              * If a macro introduces warehouse-specific SQL (date parsing/casting, string slicing, regex, boolean casting, etc.), require either adapter.dispatch or a dbt_utils equivalent.
              * Flag direct use of vendor-specific functions in macros unless guarded by dispatch (examples to call out): to_date(...), right(...), count(arg1, arg2), and other non-ANSI functions.
              * Keep macro inputs/outputs consistent because this project integrates with another dbt project (treat macros as a contract).
              * Make sure macros will work or be implemented for Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks, BigQuery, Microsoft Fabric, and DuckDB.
              * Ensure Jinja spacing/padding is consistent and readable.

        - path: "seeds/**"
          instructions: |
              Review seed changes for correctness and backward compatibility: header stability, column order, delimiter/quoting changes, and whether downstream models/tests rely on exact values.

        - path: "dbt_project.yml"
          instructions: |
              Treat this as integration-critical configuration. Review changes for package/model namespace impacts, config changes that affect compilation (e.g., quoting, model-paths, dispatch), and anything that could break the dependent dbt project.

        - path: "packages.yml"
          instructions: |
              Review for safe dependency upgrades: pin versions, note breaking changes, and confirm cross-project refs (package.model) remain valid.

        - path: "README.md"
          instructions: |
              Review for spelling errors, and also to make sure changes that are made relevant to README.md are reflected.
