{% test warn_if_null_percentage_above_zero(model, column_name) %}

{#-
    Calculates the percentage of NULL values in a column using ANSI SQL.
    Passes if the percentage is 0%.
    Warns if the percentage is between 0% and 100%.
    Includes the column name, error description (with formatted percentage),
    and a query to find NULL rows in the output.

    Args:
        model: The model object (implicitly passed by dbt).
        column_name: The name of the column to test (implicitly passed by dbt).
